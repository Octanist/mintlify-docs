title: "Update Lead"
openapi: "PATCH /api/leads"
---

Update a lead's status, value, or note. You can find leads by ID, email, or phone number.

## Finding Leads

Provide at least one identifier:

- `id` - Lead ID (most efficient)
- `email` - Lead email address
- `phone` - Lead phone number

If multiple identifiers are provided, the system will use them in order of preference: ID → email → phone.

## Status Changes

### Mark as Won

```json
{
  "id": "lead_123",
  "changedTo": "won",
  "value": 15000,
  "note": "Closed deal - annual subscription",
  "alsoQualified": true
}
```

**Requirements:**

- Must include `value` (lead value)
- Lead must have a `currency` (set during creation or previous update)
- Set `alsoQualified: true` to also mark the lead as qualified

### Mark as Qualified

```json
{
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "changedTo": "qualified",
  "value": 5000,
  "note": "Qualified during discovery call"
}
```

**Requirements:**

- Must include `value` (lead value)

### Mark as Lost

```json
{
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "changedTo": "lost",
  "note": "Not interested at this time"
}
```

**Requirements:**

- No additional requirements
