## API Key Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication via an API key passed in the `X-API-KEY` header.

### Getting Your API Key

You can find your API key in your Octanist dashboard under Settings > General > API Keys.

<Warning>
  Make sure you are in the correct organization. The API key is
  organization-specific and if you get the wrong API key, you might see leads
  going to the wrong organization or other unwanted behavior.
</Warning>

### Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `X-API-KEY` header with every request:

```bash
X-API-KEY: your_api_key_here
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://octanist.com/api/leads" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: your_api_key_here"
```

### Testing Your API Key

You can validate your API key using the check endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://octanist.com/api/check" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: your_api_key_here"
```

**Success Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

**Error Response:**

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid or missing API key"
}
```

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code or public
  repositories.
</Warning>

- Store your API key in environment variables
- Rotate your API keys regularly
- Monitor API usage for unusual activity

## Error Responses

Authentication errors will return:

- `401 Unauthorized` - Invalid or missing API key
- `403 Forbidden` - API key valid but access denied (e.g., lead rejected by filtering rules)
