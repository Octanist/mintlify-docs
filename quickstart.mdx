## Create an Octanist Account

1. **Sign Up**
   - Visit [octanist.com](https://octanist.com/) and [create a free account](https://docs.octanist.com/getting-started/).
   - After creating an account, set up an organization by entering your business name.
2. **Choose a Subscription**
   - Select a subscription plan that fits your business needs.
   - Octanist offers a **free trial** with a limited number of leads you can collect and qualify, allowing you to explore the tool.
3. **Outgoing Integrations**
   - Once your account is set up, you're ready to select outgoing integrations and qualify leads.
   - Follow the detailed guide for outgoing integrations in our [documentation](https://docs.octanist.com/outgoing-integrations/google-ads/).

## Configure Organization Settings

Before setting up outgoing integrations, navigate to **General Settings** (cog icon in the menu). 

**General**

Under **General**, you can configure essential options:

**Default Currency**
   - For European users, the default currency is set to **Euro**.
   - If you have leads in other regions, adjust the default currency accordingly.
   - You can override the default currency through your incoming integration, such as Google Tag Manager, API, or manual upload.

**Qualified Lead Settings**
   - Enable this setting if you want to add more detail to your qualification, instead of just **Won** or **Lost**. This enables the **Qualified** option in your **Open Leads** tab.
   - Give the Qualified Lead setting a name. This name must match your conversion name in an ad platform (e.g., Google Ads).

**Conversion Names**

Under **Conversion Names**, you will find the following options:

- Set up your **Conversion Names**. Ensure these names match the ones used in your ad platform (e.g., Google Ads).
- Learn more about setting conversion names in our [Google Ads Integration Guide](https://docs.octanist.com/outgoing-integrations/google-ads/).
- You can select the **Default** option to make one of these names the default conversion.
- Delete conversion names by clicking on the bin icon.

**Labels**

Under **Labels**, you will find the following options:

- Enable **Labels** to use them for organizing your leads.
- Add a label name that you can assign to a specific lead (e.g., _"Follow up started"_).
- Assign a unique color to each label.

**Danger Zone**

Under **Danger**, you will find the following:

- You can **delete** your Octanist Organization.
- All data saved in Octanist will be deleted once this option is used.
- Any active subscriptions will automatically be cancelled.
