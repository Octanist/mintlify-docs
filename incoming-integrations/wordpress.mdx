## Field Mappings

<Warning>
  Field tracking can be complex depending on your form setup and field naming
  conventions. Our support team is ready to help you configure field mappings
  correctly. Contact us at support@octanist.com for assistance.
</Warning>

### Understanding Field Mapping

Different form plugins use different technical names for their fields. For example, a "Full Name" field might be named `your-name`, `full_name`, or `text-123` in the code. Field mapping tells the Octanist plugin which of your form's field names correspond to standard data fields in Octanist.

### Configuration Steps

In the **Field Mappings** section of the plugin settings:

1. **Name Field**: Enter the exact `name` attribute of fields containing user names
2. **Email Field**: Enter the field name for email addresses
3. **Phone Field**: Enter the field name for phone numbers
4. **Custom Field**: Map any additional fields you want to capture

<Tip>
  Click **+ Add Field** to map multiple field names to the same data type. This
  is useful when you have different forms using different field names for the
  same purpose.
</Tip>

### Finding Field Names

The most reliable way to find field names is using your browser's developer tools:

1. Open the page with your form in a new browser tab
2. Right-click directly on the form field you want to map
3. Select **Inspect** from the context menu
4. Look for the `name` attribute in the highlighted HTML code, the code code look something like this:
   ![WordPress Field Name](/images/wordpress/inspect-full-input.jpg)
5. Copy the value inside the quotes (e.g., `name="your-name"` → use `your-name`)
   ![WordPress Field Name](/images/wordpress/inspect-name.jpg)

**Example HTML:**

```html
<input
  type="text"
  name="your-name"
  value=""
  size="40"
  class="wpcf7-form-control"
  placeholder="Your Name"
/>
```

You would use `your-name` in your field mapping.

<Warning>
  This can be a complex process. Contact us at support@octanist.com for
  assistance. We would be happy to help you configure field mappings correctly.
</Warning>

### Handling Multiple Fields

**Combining First and Last Name:**

- Form has fields: `first-name` and `last-name`
- In Name Fields mapping: Add both `first-name` and `last-name`
- Plugin automatically combines them when forms are submitted

**Different Forms with Different Names:**

- Contact form uses: `contact-name`
- Quote form uses: `quote-name`
- In Name Fields mapping: Add both field names
- Plugin treats both as "Name" data

## Advanced Settings

### Data Transmission Options

- **Send data to Octanist**: Master switch to enable/disable data sending to Octanist API
- **Send data to (GTM) Datalayer**: Push form data to Google Tag Manager's dataLayer

When GTM integration is enabled, data is pushed with this structure:

```javascript
{
  "event": "submit_lead_form",
  "user_data": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "phone_number": "+1234567890",
    "company_name": "John Doe",
    "custom": "Custom field data"
  }
}
```

### Debug Mode

Enable **Debug Mode** to print diagnostic information to your browser's developer console. This helps troubleshoot tracking issues but should only be enabled when necessary.

## Testing & Validation

1. Fill out and submit a test form on your website
2. Check your Octanist dashboard for the new lead data
3. If using Debug Mode, check browser console for "Octanist Debug" messages
4. Verify field mappings are working correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Forms Not Being Tracked

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check Plugin Status">
    - Verify the Octanist ID is entered correctly
    - Ensure "Send data to Octanist" is enabled
    - Confirm the plugin is activated
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Verify Form Plugin Support">
    - Check if your form plugin is in the compatibility table
    - For unsupported forms, add `octanist-form` CSS class to the `<form>` element
    - Enable Debug Mode to see console messages
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Field Mapping Issues">
    - Field names must match exactly (case-sensitive)
    - Use browser inspection to verify field names
    - Check for typos in field mapping configuration
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Data Appears Incorrect

- **Combined fields**: Multiple fields mapped to the same type are separated by a pipe (`|`) symbol
- **Missing data**: Verify all required fields are properly mapped
- **Wrong values**: Double-check field name mapping using browser inspection

  collection, don't hesitate to contact our support team at
