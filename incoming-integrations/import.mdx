## 1. Set Up the Import

Within Octanist, navigate to **Integrations > Incoming**.

1. Click on **Import**.
2. Follow the requirements for setting up the manual import.

Before uploading your file, ensure that the **time of conversion** (when a lead became a sale) is formatted correctly. This step is essential for tying sales back to campaigns, such as Google Ads.

### Date and Time Formats

**Important:**  
Use one of the following date and time formats in your CSV or Excel file. If a different format is used, the import will fail.

| **Type**      | **Format**               | **Example of Current Timestamp**    |
|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| ISO 8601      | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ | 2024-12-15T20:47:03.409Z           |
| Short date    | YYYY-MM-DD               | 2024-12-15                         |
| US date       | MM/DD/YYYY               | 12/15/2024                         |

**Note:** Consistency in date formats across your file is crucial for accurate importing. For more information on correct formats, check [this page](https://octanist.com/formats-guide).

### Additional Requirements

- **Missing Data:** Leave fields empty for missing valuesâ€”do not use placeholders like "-" or "0."
- Review your file for these requirements to ensure a smooth import process.

## 2. Download Template (Recommended)

To minimize errors, download our [CSV template](https://octanist.com/integrations/incoming/import/).

1. Open the template in your preferred editor.
2. Paste your leads and fill in the required fields.
3. Save your file when ready.

When your file is prepared, proceed to the **Start Import Process** section in Octanist.

## 3. Importing Your Leads

1. Click on **Start Import Process** on the [Manual Upload page](https://octanist.com/integrations/incoming/import/).
2. Select the file that contains your leads.
3. A preview of the import will appear. Press **Next**.

### Mapping Columns and Values

Match the columns in your file to the corresponding fields in Octanist:

- For example, if your file uses "Converted Leads," you can map it to **"Won Leads"** (the term used by Octanist).

Once the mapping is complete, press **Next**.

### Final Review and Upload

1. Review the final mapping and data summary.
2. If everything is correct, press **Confirm** to start the upload.
3. Your leads will be imported and immediately available in Octanist.

### Troubleshooting

If errors occur:

- Check that the **date format** matches one of the accepted formats.
- Contact [support@octanist.com](mailto:support@octanist.com) for assistance.
