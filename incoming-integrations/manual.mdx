You can implement our API in any system of your choice.

In an API request, either a `gclid`, `fbc`, or `ga4cid` is required, and either the `name`, `phone`, or `email` is required to identify leads.

## URL

This is the URL you need to send the request to. Send a GET request to this URL with the parameters:

```bash
https://octanist.com/api/integrations/incoming/manual/{YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID}/

```

Once you have the parameters, you can send a request to the API.  
The data will then be visible in the dashboard under "Open Leads."

## Organization ID

Before sending a request to the API, you need to retrieve your **Organization ID**.  
The Organization ID is included as part of the URL used for the API request.

You can find your Organization ID in the dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Incoming Integrations**.
2. Select **Manual**.
3. Generate the URL with the required parameters. Your Organization ID will be included in this URL.
