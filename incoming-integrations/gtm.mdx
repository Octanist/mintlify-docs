## 2. Prepare the Website

- To send lead data to Octanist, the data must be available on the website. We highly recommend using a [**dataLayer**](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/datalayer) **push event** to ensure consistency and robust measurement.
- Ensure the lead data is placed in the dataLayer. Ask a developer to implement the following code to activate the dataLayer push after a lead form is submitted:

<Note>
  Dear [WEBDEVELOPER],

  We are currently in the process, of setting up [Octanist](https://octanist.com/), a tool that helps us determine the true value of the leads coming through our website. To make this work and send data effectively to Octanist, we need to ensure the data is pushed to the [dataLayer](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/datalayer). This will allow us to capture the necessary information using Google Tag Manager and send it to Octanist. Therefore, we kindly request adding the following code to the backend of our forms:

  ```html
  <script>
    var dataLayer = dataLayer || [];
    dataLayer.push({
      event: "submit_lead_form",
      user_data: {
        email: yourEmailVariable,
        phone_number: yourPhoneVariable,
        name: yourNameVariable, // optional
      },
    });
  </script>
  ```

  Please let us know once this is in place and if you need any assistance.

  Kind regards, [YOUR DETAILS]
</Note>
