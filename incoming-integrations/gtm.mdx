## Setup video

Need help setting up octanist? Watch our setup video. For the most up-to-date implementation guide, please follow the written guide below.

_Please note that you do not need to upload the GTM template manually; you can obtain it from the Template Gallery (see section 4.2)._

## 2. Prepare the Website

- To send lead data to Octanist, the data must be available on the website. We highly recommend using a [**dataLayer**](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/datalayer) **push event** to ensure consistency and robust measurement.
- Ensure the lead data is placed in the dataLayer. Ask a developer to implement the following code to activate the dataLayer push after a lead form is submitted:

> Dear [WEBDEVELOPER], 
>
> 
> We are, currently in the process of setting up [Octanist](https://octanist.com/), a tool that helps us determine the true value of the leads coming through our website. To make this work and send data effectively to Octanist, we need to ensure the data is pushed to the [dataLayer](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/datalayer).This will allow us to capture the necessary information using Google Tag Manager and send it to Octanist. Therefore, we kindly request adding the following code to the backend of our forms:

```html
<script>
  var dataLayer = dataLayer || [];
  dataLayer.push({
    event: "submit_lead_form",
    user_data: {
      email: yourEmailVariable,
      phone_number: yourPhoneVariable,
      company_name: yourCompanyVariable, // optional
    },
  });
</script>
```

> Please let us know once this is in place and if you need any assistance.
>
> Kind regards,\
> [YOUR DETAILS]

![](/images/google-tag-manager/incoming-gtm-octanist-to-workspace.jpg)

### 3.3 Configure the Tag

- Create a new tag: **Octanist - Offline Conversion Tracking**. _After successfully importing the template, the Octanist Tag should appear under the Custom Tab._
- Enter your **Octanist ID**.
- Add dataLayer variables for email address, phone number, and company name.
- Set the trigger. For example, in step 2 we created an event for the `submit_lead_form` trigger.

### 3.4 Test and Publish

- Test the form using the GTM debug mode.
- Publish the container once everything works correctly.

---

## 4 Optional

### 4.1 Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

- Enter the **GA4 Measurement ID** (e.g., `G-12345678`).
- Optionally, add extra fields for better lead qualification.

### 4.2 Marketing Campaign Data

- Enter custom UTM parameters saved in a GTM variable.
- You can extract these parameters with the help of your web developer or technical web analyst.
- These parameters will be visible in the dashboard under **Source / Medium / Campaign**.

### 4.3 Consent

- By default, Google Consent Mode is used to determine the user's consent preferences. If you have implemented this, you do not need to change this setting.
- You can also use the **Manual Consent Setting**, which allows you to pass your own consent parameters. Please return them as `Granted` or `Denied` — use exactly this format and capitalization.
- For more details, refer to our [Consent Documentation](https://docs.octanist.com/user-consent/consent-mode).

### 4.4 Custom Domain Delivery

- By default, leave this field blank.
- Here, you can add a custom domain for your Octanist environment. This feature is only available upon request via [support@octanist.com](mailto:support@octanist.com).
