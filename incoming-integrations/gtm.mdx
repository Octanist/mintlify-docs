## 2. Prepare the Website

* To send lead data to Octanist, the data must be available on the website. We highly recommend using a [**dataLayer**](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/datalayer) **push event** to ensure consistency and robust measurement.

* Ensure the lead data is placed in the dataLayer. Ask a developer to implement the following code to activate the dataLayer push after a lead form is submitted:

> Dear \[Recipient],&#x20;
>
> We are currently in the process of setting up [Octanist](https://octanist.com/), a tool that helps us determine the true value of the leads coming through our website. To make this work and send data effectively to Octanist, we need to ensure the data is pushed to the [dataLayer](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/datalayer).
>
> This will allow us to capture the necessary information using Google Tag Manager and send it to Octanist. Therefore, we kindly request adding the following code to the backend of our forms:

```html
<script>
var dataLayer = dataLayer || [];
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'submit_lead_form',
  user_data: {
    email: yourEmailVariable,
    phone_number: yourPhoneVariable,
    company_name: yourCompanyVariable // optional
  }
});
</script>
```

> Please let us know once this is in place and if you need any assistance.
>
> Kind regards,

### 3.3 Configure the Tag

* Create a new tag: **Octanist - Offline Conversion Tracking**.
  *After successfully importing the template, the Octanist Tag should appear under the Custom Tab.*

* Enter your **Octanist ID**.

* Add dataLayer variables for email address, phone number, and company name.

* Set the trigger. For example, in step 2 we created an event for the `submit_lead_form` trigger.

### 3.4 Test and Publish

* Test the form using the GTM debug mode.

* Publish the container once everything works correctly.

***

## 4. Optional: Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

* Enter the **GA4 Measurement ID** (e.g., `G-12345678`).

* Optionally add extra fields for better lead qualification.
