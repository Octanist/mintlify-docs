## 2. Prepare the Website

- To send lead data to Octanist, the data must be available on the website. We highly recommend using a **dataLayer push event** to ensure consistency and robust measurement.

- Make sure the lead data is placed in the dataLayer. Ask a developer to implement the following code to activate the dataLayer push after a lead form is completed:

> _Dear \[Recipient],_
>
> _We are currently in the process of setting up_ [_Octanist_](https://octanist.com/)_, a tool that helps us determine the true value of the leads coming through our website._
>
> _To make this work and send data effectively to Octanist, we need to ensure the data is pushed to the_ [_dataLayer_](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/datalayer)_. This will allow us to capture the necessary information using Google Tag Manager and send it to Octanist._
>
> _Therefore, we kindly request adding the following code to the backend of our forms:_

```tsx
<script>
var dataLayer = dataLayer || [];
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'submit_lead_form',
  user_data: {
    email: yourEmailVariable,
    phone_number: yourPhoneVariable,
    company_name: yourCompanyVariable // optional
  }
});
</script>
```

> Please let us know once this is in place and if you need any assistance.
>
> Kind regards,
