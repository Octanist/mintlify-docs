Once connected, go to the **Configure** tab.

Here you can map the fields you want to send to Octanist. These fields come from your trigger step.\
You can insert values easily by typing `/` to search for the Zapier variables.

**Example:**\
If your trigger is “New Gmail Email,” you might map the Gmail **From Name** into the Octanist **Name** field.

We also recommend adding **UTM parameters** to ensure proper source attribution.

### **Testing the Lead**

After configuring your fields:

1. Go to the **Test** tab in Zapier.
2. Run the test to send a lead to Octanist.
3. Check Octanist to confirm that your lead was received correctly.

If something looks wrong, verify the following:

- An **email address** is present
- A **phone number** is present (if available)
- A **name** is present
- Custom fields and UTM values are correctly included

These values, especially the email, are important for qualifying and sending leads to other channels.

When everything works as expected, publish your Zap.

You are now ready. All incoming leads will be automatically delivered to Octanist.
