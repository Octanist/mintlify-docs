## 1. Overview

The Google Analytics 4 (GA4) integration sends your marked closed, open, and converted leads to Google Analytics 4. This process uses the [Google Analytics 4 Measurement Protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4). This server-to-server solution ensures all quantitative lead data is sent to Google Analytics 4 and tied to specific channels. No personal or client data is sent to Google Analytics 4.

<Warning>
  **Note:** While the Measurement Protocol sends 100% of the data to Google
  Analytics 4, it may face challenges linking data back to a user or session.
  The handling of the Client ID and Session ID is managed by Octanist. Events
  sent through the Measurement Protocol may result in "(not set)" values for
  source/medium attribution.
</Warning>

## 2. How the Measurement Protocol Works

1. **"Won" Leads:**
   Whenever a user is marked as a "Won" Lead, the event  is sent to Google Analytics 4 along with corresponding parameters (e.g. the **value** and **currency**).
2. **"Open" Leads:**
   When a value is added or updated for an "Open" Lead, the event  is sent to Google Analytics 4. The content of the note is passed as the parameter `lead_status`.
3. **"Lost" Leads:**
   If a user does not convert and is marked as a "Lost" Lead, the event  is sent. The parameter `unconvert_lead_reason` contains the reason for the lost lead, based on the note content.

## 3. Setup Instructions

## 4. Reporting in Google Analytics 4

Add the [custom dimensions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/14240153?hl=en) `lead_status` and `unconvert_lead_reason` to view the text values of your notes entered in Octanist.

**Enter the custom dimensions as follows:**

- **Dimension Name**: The name of the dimension (e.g., `lead_status`; you can name this as you prefer).
- **Description**: A description of the custom dimension (e.g., _"The status of a lead (e.g., 'Called Lead, waiting for follow-up')."_).
- **Event Parameter**: This must be `lead_status` or `unconvert_lead_reason` for Octanist Insights.

To improve reporting, mark the `close_convert_lead` event as a **Key Event (Conversion)** in GA4.
This will help you better understand the user journey and simplify reporting.
