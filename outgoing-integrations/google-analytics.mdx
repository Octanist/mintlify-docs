## 1. Overview

The google analytics 4 (GA4) integration sends your marked closed, open, and converted leads to google analytics 4. This process uses the [google analytics 4 Measurement Protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4).
This server-to-server solution ensures all quantitative lead data is sent to google analytics 4 and tied to specific channels. No personal or client data is sent to google analytics 4.

> **Note:** While the Measurement Protocol sends 100% of the data to google analytics 4, it may face challenges linking data back to a user or session. Handling of the Client ID and Session ID is managed by Octanist.

## 2. How the Measurement Protocol Works

1. **"Won" Leads:**
   Whenever a user is marked as a "Won" Lead, the event [`close_convert_lead`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/reference/events?client_type=gtm#close_convert_lead) is sent to google analytics 4 along with corresponding parameters (e.g. the **value** and **currency**).

2. **"Open" Leads:**
   When a value is added or updated for an "Open" Lead, the event [`working_lead`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/reference/events?client_type=gtm#working_lead) is sent to google analytics 4. The content of the note is passed as the parameter `lead_status`.

3. **"Lost" Leads:**
   If a user does not convert and is marked as a "Lost" Lead, the event [`close_unconvert_lead`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/reference/events?client_type=gtm#close_unconvert_lead) is sent. The parameter `unconvert_lead_reason` contains the reason for the lost lead, based on the note content.

## 3. Setup Instructions

1. In your Octanist account, go to **Integrations > Outgoing**.

2. Select **google analytics 4**.

3. Fill in a name for the integration (e.g., *Octanist - GA4 Integration*).

4. Enter your **GA4 Measurement ID**.

   * This can be found in your GA4 account under **Data Streams**. See [Google's guide](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12270356?hl=en) for details.

5. Enter your **GA4 API Key**:

   * In your GA4 Data Stream, click **Measurement Protocol API Secrets**.

   * Create a key and give it a clear name (e.g., *Octanist - GA4 Integration*).

6. Click **Create google analytics 4 Integration**.

## 4. Reporting in google analytics 4

Add the [custom dimensions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/14240153?hl=en) `lead_status` and `unconvert_lead_reason` to view the text values of your notes entered in Octanist.

To improve reporting, mark the `close_convert_lead` event as a **Key Event (Conversion)** in GA4.
This will help you better understand the user journey and simplify reporting.
