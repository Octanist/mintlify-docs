With the Microsoft Ads integration, you can send qualified leads from Octanist using Microsoft Click ID matching. This integration uses the **Import from Clicks** functionality — similar to Google Ads — to upload your offline conversions to Microsoft Ads.

<Note>
  **Note:** This is an advanced integration. Familiarity with Microsoft Ads
  conversion tracking and lead attribution is required.
</Note>

### Prerequisites

- A [Microsoft Ads account](https://ads.microsoft.com/)
- An Octanist [**Serious Business**](https://octanist.com/pricing/) package

## 1. Setting Up in Octanist

1. Go to [octanist.com](https://octanist.com/) and navigate to [**General \> Manage Conversion Names**](https://octanist.com/organization/settings/).
2. Under **Manage Conversion Names**, add clear and concise conversion names. For example: _Converted Lead - Octanist_.

<Warning>
  Use clear and consistent conversion names. These **must exactly match** the conversion names used in your Microsoft Ads account.

\
 You may reuse conversion names already used in other integrations.

</Warning>

1. Go to **Integrations \> Outgoing**.
2. Select **Microsoft Ads**.
3. Name your integration clearly, such as: _Company Name - Octanist - Microsoft Ads_.
4. Once saved, you'll receive a unique URL — **copy and save this**, as you'll need it when setting up the upload in Microsoft Ads.

## 2. Creating a Conversion Goal in Microsoft Ads

Once your outgoing integration is created in Octanist, switch to your Microsoft Ads account.

1. Navigate to **Tools \> Conversion Tracking**, then select **\+ Conversion Goal**.
2. Choose the following options:
   - **Conversion Goal Type:** Offline
   - **Goal Category:** Submit Lead Forms
   - **Name:** Use the **exact same name** as in Octanist (e.g., _Converted Lead - Octanist_)

<Warning>
  The conversion goal name in Microsoft Ads must exactly match the one defined
  in Octanist.
</Warning>

3. Under **Revenue**, set your **Conversion Action Value** (e.g., 1 EUR or your preferred value).
4. Under **Advanced Settings**, set:
   - **Include in Conversions?** → No

<Note>
  We recommend not including the goal in conversions initially. Activate this
  once you’ve collected at least 30 converted leads for better optimization.
</Note>

5. Under **Enhanced Conversions**, select **Disable** (you can enable this later if desired).

  Scheduling uploads ensures that Octanist leads are regularly synced with
  Microsoft Ads without manual intervention.
