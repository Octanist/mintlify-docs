The Google Ads integration uses the "Import from Clicks" functionality in Google Ads, allowing it to upload both newly converted leads and previously converted leads that occurred before the connection was established.

## Table of Contents

1. [Octanist](#1-octanist)

2. [Google Ads](#2-google-ads)

## 1. Octanist

1. Go to [octanist.com](https://octanist.com/) and navigate to General > [Manage Conversion Names.](https://octanist.com/organization/settings/)

2. Under '**Manage Conversion Names**' add clear and concise conversion names, for example: _Converted Lead - Octanist_.

<Warning>
  Ensure you choose clear and concise conversion names. These must exactly match

4. Go to [octanist.com](https://octanist.com/) and navigate to **Integrations > Outgoing**.

5. Select **Google Ads**.

6. Give the integration a clear and concise name, such as: '_Company Name - Octanist - Google Ads Integration._'&#x20;

<Tip>
  *This name is for internal use and helps you easily identify the integration,
  especially if you plan to set up multiple integrations for different Google
  Ads accounts.*
</Tip>

7. Octanist will generate a unique link. **Save this link carefully, as you will only receive it once.**
   The link will look like this:`https://api.octanist.com/integrations/outgoing/googleads/{{Octanist ID}}/?apikey=oct_{{Unique Key}}`

5. In the next step, select **Converted Lead** as the conversion goal.

7. Save the conversion action and click **Next**.

8. On the next screen, you will be prompted to set up your new data source. Do not proceed with this step yet. Click **Done** instead.

### Configuring Uploads

1. Go back to **Goals > Uploads**.

2. Open the **Schedules** tab and add a new schedule:

   - Choose _HTTPS_ as the source.

   - Enter the link provided by Octanist in the _Source URL_ field.

   - Set _Frequency_ to _Weekly on Sunday_.
     (Daily synchronization is not necessary unless leads convert within 24 hours.)

   - Choose a preferred time, for example, _0:00_.

3. Save the schedule.

## Important

Google Ads will now start retrieving converted leads.

If you encounter an error, it may be because no converted leads are yet available in Octanist. This issue will resolve itself with the next upload.

You have now successfully created a connection between Octanist and Google Ads.
