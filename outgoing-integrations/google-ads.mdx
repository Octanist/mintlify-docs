## 1. Octanist

1. Go to [octanist.com](https://octanist.com/) and navigate to **Integrations > Outgoing**.
2. Select **Google Ads**.
3. Give the integration a clear and concise name, for example:  
   _Company Name - Octanist - Google Ads Integration_.
4. Octanist will generate a unique link. **Save this link carefully, as you will only receive it once.**  
   The link will look like this:

   `https://api.octanist.com/integrations/outgoing/googleads/{{Octanist ID}}/?apikey=oct_{{Unique Key}}`

## 2. Google Ads

1. Go to [Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/aw/overview).
2. Navigate to your account and then to **Goals > Overview**.
3. Create a new conversion action and select **Import**:
   - Under import, choose **CRMs, files, or other data sources**.
   - Then select **Conversions from clicks**.
4. When prompted to select a data source, choose _"Skip this step and set up a data source later."_
5. In the next step, select **Converted Lead** as the conversion goal.
6. Give this conversion goal a name, for example: _Octanist - Converted Lead_.
   > **Note:** This name must match exactly with the conversion action name in Octanist.
7. Save the conversion action.

### Configuring Uploads

8. Go back to **Goals > Uploads**.
9. Open the **Schedules** tab and add a new schedule:
   - Choose _HTTPS_ as the source.
   - Enter the link provided by Octanist in the _Source URL_ field.
   - Set _Frequency_ to _Weekly on Sunday_.  
     (Daily synchronization is not necessary unless leads convert within 24 hours.)
   - Choose a preferred time, for example, _0:00_.
10. Save the schedule.

## Important

Google Ads will now start retrieving converted leads.

If you encounter an error, it may be because no converted leads are yet available in Octanist. This issue will resolve itself with the next upload.

You have now successfully created a connection between Octanist and Google Ads.
