## 1. Octanist

1. Go to [octanist.com](https://octanist.com/) and navigate to **Integrations \> Outgoing**.
2. Select **Google Ads**.
3. Give the integration a clear and concise name, such as: _Company Name - Octanist - Google Ads Integration_.

<Tip>
  This name is for internal use and helps you easily identify the integration, especially if you plan to set up multiple integrations for different Google Ads accounts.
</Tip>

**Advanced:**

Under the advanced section of this integration, you will find two optional options:

**Manual Consent:** Enable this option if you want to manually override the consent settings of leads, setting it to "Granted". We recommend leaving this disabled. It should only be enabled when you've encountered issues with consent settings. Please refer to our [Consent Mode documentation](https://docs.octanist.com/user-consent/consent-mode) to learn more.

[**Enhanced Conversions for Leads**](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11021502?hl=en)**:** Enabling this option sends hashed [first-party data](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6242605?hl=en) to Google Ads using SHA-256 hashing. When enabling this option, make sure to also enable it in Google Ads by navigating to:\
**Goals \> Settings \> Enhanced Conversions for Leads \> Managed through Google Tag Manager**.

4. Octanist will generate a unique link. **Save this link carefully, as you will only receive it once.**\
   The link will look like this:\
   `https://api.octanist.com/integrations/outgoing/googleads/{{Octanist ID}}/?apikey=oct_{{Unique Key}}`

   - Give it a concise name, e.g., _Converted Lead - Octanist_.

     <Warning>
       This name must match exactly with the conversion action name in Octanist.
     </Warning>

### Configuring Uploads

2. Open the **Schedules** tab and add a new schedule:
   - Choose **HTTPS** as the source.
   - Enter the link provided by Octanist in the **Source URL** field.
   - Set **Frequency** to **Every 24 hours**.\
     _(Daily synchronization is not always necessary, unless leads convert within 24 hours.)_
   - Choose a preferred time, e.g., **0:00**.
3. Save the schedule.

## Important

Google Ads will now begin retrieving converted leads.

If you encounter an error, it may be because no converted leads are currently available in Octanist. This issue will resolve itself with the next upload.

You have now successfully created a connection between Octanist and Google Ads.
