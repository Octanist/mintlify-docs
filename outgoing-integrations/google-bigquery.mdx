## 1. BigQuery Setup

### 1.1 Project and Billing

Before setting up Google BigQuery for Octanist, you need a BigQuery environment with billing enabled. Donâ€™t worry â€” the cost is typically between â‚¬0â€“â‚¬1 per month for storing data.

1. Go to [Google BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery).
2. Sign in with the Google account you want to associate with the BigQuery environment. We recommend using a client-owned account or one that the client can always access.
3. Create or select a project. Use a clear and concise name â€” you can't change it later.
4. Select the appropriate organization (usually your business or your client's), then click **Create**.

Search for **Billing** and open it. You must set up a billing account to enable and use specific APIs required by Google BigQuery.

Next, search for **BigQuery API**, open it, and click **Enable**. A green checkmark will confirm activation.

### 1.2 Enabling APIs and Permissions

Now, search for **IAM & Admin**, and click **Grant Access**.

![Grant Access](/images/google-bigquery-outgoing-integration-grant-access.jpg)

Add relevant users (e.g., your team, your agencyâ€™s email, your client). Assign the **Owner** or **BigQuery Admin** role so they can manage the lead data and perform analysis.

![Add Roles](/images/google-bigquery-outgoing-integration-add-roles.jpg)

Return to the search bar, search for **BigQuery**, and click it to open the BigQuery Studio.

### 1.3 Creating a Dataset and Table

1. In BigQuery Studio, click the three dots next to your project name and select **Create dataset**.

![Create Dataset](/images/google-bigquery-outgoing-integration-create-dataset.jpg)

2. Enter a **Dataset ID** (e.g., `octanist_dataset`). This cannot be changed later.
3. Choose a **Region** close to your business (e.g., a region containing "europe" or the "EU" multi-region).

![Dataset ID and Region](/images/google-bigquery-outgoing-integration-create-dataset-id-and-region.jpg)

Once the dataset is created:

1. Click the three dots next to the dataset name and choose **Create table**.

![Create Table](/images/google-bigquery-outgoing-integration-create-table.jpg)

2. In the Create Table menu:
   - Select **Empty table**.
   - Ensure the project and dataset are filled in correctly.
   - Enter a **Table Name** (e.g., `export_bigquery_integration` or `exported_leads_octanist`).
3. Scroll down to **Partitioning Settings**:
   - Set **Partition by ingestion time**
   - Choose **By day**

This keeps the dataset manageable and cost-efficient.

4. Scroll up to **Schema**, switch to **Edit as text**, and paste the schema below:

```

After this is set up, click **Create Table**. The settings should look as follows:

![Table Settings](/images/image.png)

Lastly, before switching back to Octanist, click on the dataset (the square icon with four dots), then click **Edit Details** in the top right.\
\
Uncheck **Enable table expiration**. Make sure this option is disabled, otherwise, your data will be deleted after 60 days.

## Octanist

Now head back to Octanist and create a new outgoing integration:\
ðŸ‘‰ [Create Integration](https://octanist.com/integrations/outgoing/new/)

1. Select **Google BigQuery**.
2. Enter a clear and concise name for the integration.
3. Under **Google Connection**, click **Connect** and log in using the Google account with the necessary BigQuery permissions (as set in the IAM & Admin section above).

> Note: A second window may open during the authentication process. If it does, complete the setup in that window, then close it. This is related to Google Authentication and will be improved in future updates.

4. Enter your:
   - **Project name**
   - **Dataset ID**
   - **Table name**

The final setup should look like this:

![Octanist Setup](/images/bigquery-octanist-outgoing-integration-setup-octanist.png)

Once configured, you can start qualifying your leads â€” these will be automatically sent to BigQuery.

### The following lead statuses will be sent to BigQuery:

- **Won Leads**
- **Qualified Leads**
- **Lost Leads**

Each lead includes a timestamp, allowing you to calculate the time it takes for a lead to convert to a sale.

If youâ€™d like to export historical leads, we can provide that. Just send your request to [support@octanist.com](mailto:support@octanist.com).
