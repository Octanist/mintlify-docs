## 1. Overview

The Meta Ads Integration uses the Conversion API to send converted leads to Meta. This integration leverages the `_fbc` and `_fbp` cookies to link your converted leads back to their original campaigns and ad interactions.

<Warning>
  **Important:** Converted leads that occurred before setting up the integration
  cannot be sent to Meta. Only leads marked as "Winner" after the connection is
  established will be transmitted.
</Warning>

## 2. Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure Conversion Names in Octanist

1. Go to [Octanist](https://octanist.com/) and navigate to **General > Manage Conversion Names**.

2. Under **Manage Conversion Names**, add clear and descriptive names for your conversions (e.g., _Converted Lead - Octanist_). If needed, create new conversion names. These will appear in your Meta Events Manager.

### Step 2: Set Up the Meta Ads Integration

1. Go to [Octanist](https://octanist.com/) and navigate to **Integrations > Outgoing**.

2. Select **Meta / Facebook Ads**.

3. Fill in the following details:

   - **Name:** Choose a name for the integration (e.g., _Octanist - Meta Integration_).

   - **Pixel ID:** Find this in your Meta Business Manager under:

     - **Events Manager > Data Sources > Your Meta Pixel > Copy Pixel ID**.![](/images/meta/meta-find-meta-pixel-id.jpg)

   - **Access Token:** Obtain this in your Meta Business Manager:

     - **Events Manager > Data Sources > Your Meta Pixel > Generate or Copy Access Token**.![](/images/meta/meta-find-and-generate-access-token.jpg)

<Warning>
  **Security Note:** Your Access Token is sensitive information that enables
  direct data transmission to your Meta Ad account. Keep it secure and only
  share it with trusted platforms.
</Warning>

- **Original Event Name:** Specify the event name that generated the original lead (e.g., _Lead_, _Contact_, or _Request Quotation_). This helps link converted leads back to their originating event.

In the end the field should look something like this:![](/images/meta/meta-outgoing-connection-setup.jpg)

Once the integration is set up, monitor the data flow in Meta by navigating to:

- **Events Manager > Data Sources > Your Meta Pixel > Overview**.

Check for correct data transmission and review performance metrics to ensure proper tracking and optimization of your campaigns.
